  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a probabilistic inference technique allowing an autonomous robot to estimate its location from onboard camera and inertial sensors and construct a map of its surroundings in real time. SLAM research has been instrumental in allowing robotics to transition from the factory floor to numerous applications in unstructured environments, such as autonomous transportation, structure inspection, mining, environmental monitoring, and many more. The traditional SLAM algorithms operate in a passive estimation setting, where data is provided to the system but its acquisition is not optimized. Autonomous systems employing SLAM see but do not look. Our central research objective is to develop a novel planning algorithm for SLAM by actively optimizing the robotâ€™s trajectory to obtain more informative data and minimize uncertainty in its environment model.

  One of the significant tasks for implementing autonomous robots in practice is to guarantee safety under the executed planning. The global information of the environment is hard to acquire in unknown and unstructured space. The on-board sensors equipped with robots instead enables perception of the local information. We pursue to found a robust safe navigation to reach a goal without collisions with objects under uncertain robot and environment models via utilizing only local information. The uncertain models can be identified online through synthesizing a safe navigation with a dynamics learning using deep neural network.
<!--  Recent advancement of machine learning has extremely enhanced the capability of robotic systems in terms of perception, planning, navigation, etc. However, under uncertainty of the environmental model and dynamics of the robot, there still remains significant challanges in planning and operating the robot to accomplish some assigned tasks with guaranteeing some constraints such as safety verification or limitation of control effort. To tackle the problem, we propose an optimal control and reinforcement learning formulation to maximize a long term reward function together with the constraints on the state and action spaces. --> We will demonstrate such a sophisticated control and learning algorithms in the hardware experiments of ground robot and quadrotors.

Computational modeling of complex physical systems arising in thermal, chemical, fluid, and network systems is governed by a spatio-temporal dynamics, mathematically described as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In particular, a thermodynamic model of liquid-solid phase transition, such as melting and solidification phenomena, has been known as the Stefan problem which is a special class of a nonlinear PDE. While a numerical analysis of the Stefan problem has been considered intensely, the control and estimation problems have been studied relatively fewer in spite of its importance in practical science and engineering. The central goal of our theoretical work is to develop a control and estimation design for the Stefan problem and general other class of PDEs governing complex physical systems. We also conduct experiments of melting paraffin of an energy storage material to test and validate the designed feedback control algorithm.

    Extremum Seeking (ES) has been widely utilized as a real-time model-free optimization method arising in adaptive control. ES is literally a user-friendly tool owing to its model-free nature. However, most of the existing contributions of ES have been achieved for a plant governed by Ordinally Differential Equations (ODEs). Motivated by various applications of complex physical systems mentioned above, we pursue to develop a novel ES design to extend the class of systems to PDEs and time-delay systems. Furthermore, inspired by a recent intensive advancement of data science and machine learning, we also pursue to develop a novel data-driven ES algorithm for iterative-learning of unknown parameters as an alternative approach to the well-known stochastic gradient descent.

    Energy consumption by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) usage in buildings is tremendously dominant. To reduce the energy consumption by HVAC, developing efficient thermal energy storage systems is of high demand. The conventional sensible heat storage systems store the energy by change of the temperature in a single-phase material, which owns a limited capacity. Instead, the latent heat storage system, which stores the thermal energy by change of the phase in a phase change material (PCM), owns a much larger capacity under a constant temperature than the sensible heat. One significant challenge for the usage of the latent heat storage is how to estimate and control the stored energy in PCM, since the physical phenomena are complicated. I have established an implementable control algorithm for storing the desired amount of energy in PCM, through extending the control design for the Stefan PDE system to the digital control design with taking into account the effect of the heat loss, and conducted experiments of the proposed thermal control using paraffin as PCM.
    <!--The experiment was success, where the convergence of the liquid-solid interface to a desired position was observed, thereby the desired amount of energy was stored. -->

Additive Manufactuing (AM), also known as 3D-printing, is a state-of-the-art manufacturing technology which has emerged rapidly in the recent decade as observed from the growth in global market. AM's impact relies on products and supply chains in numerous industries such as automobiles, consumer electronics, aerospace, medical devices, etc. We study both of two popular materials dealt in AM, that are, polymer and metal. In polymer AM, we focus on screw extrusion process which enables a fast printing, and build a control system that stabilizes the filament production rate. In metal AM, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is the most common technique of the powder-bed fusion AM processes that fabricate structurally
sound three-dimensional products from a computer-aided design (CAD) models. We design robust control system for laser power that enables a desired geometry of the melt pool in layer-by-layer process of SLS-based metal AM.

    Recent rapid advancement of the lithium-ion batteries realizes the sufficiently large capacity and high power to be utilized in many technologies diverging from the electric vehicles to smart grids. The task of software development for the advanced battery management is to found a creditable algorithm to estimate unmeasureable important variables of the batteries, such as State-of-Charge, State-of-Health, State-of-Power, in a accurate and implementable manner. Full physics-based models consisting of considerable amount of particles in electrodes and electrolyte render a quite heavy computation which does not enable an online execution, while oversimplified equivalent circuit models do not accomplish sufficient accuracy in some regime.  We have innovated an accurate SoC estimation method for the lithium-ion batteries with phase transition materials, such as LiCoO2 and LiFePO4, by designing a state estimator for an idealized electrochemical PDE model. Our algorithm is sufficiently fast to be implementable online, highly accurate in SoC estimation, and strongly robust to noisy measurement and model uncertainty. <!--The elimination of more than 15 % error in SoC within 5 minutes was demonstrated, even under highly noisy measurements.-->


<!--    Battery management is crucial for safe and efficient use of numerous kinds of electronics such as smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles, etc. Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) has several attractive features as active material in lithium-ion batteries such as thermal safety, cost effectiveness, and long cycle life. LFP and other common active materials (e.g. Lithium Cobalt Oxide) show unique charge-discharge characteristics due to an underlying crystallographic solid-solid phase transition. We explore the electrochemical models of the phase transition materials for the Single Particle Model (SPM), and develop State-of-Charge (SoC) estimation algorithm via an observer for the concentration profile of lithium ions from the SPM. -->

    After the year 2000, the amount of Arctic sea ice starts drastically declining, as observed from the satellite data by NASA. The sea ice plays a significant role in climate dynamics due to its high reflectivity, thereby the decline of the sea ice leads to more absorption of the solar energy into the earth, and thus the global warming is promoted. To accurately predict the future amount of the sea ice, the spatial temperature profile inside the sea ice needs to be known. However, the spatially distributed temperature in sea ice is difficult to recover in realtime using a limited number of thermal sensors. Hence, the online estimation of the sea ice temperature profile based on some available measurements is crucial for the prediction of the climate change. I have developed an accurate estimation for the sea ice temperature profile utilizing satellite data of the surface temperature and the thickness of the sea ice.
    <!-- The proposed method achieves accurate estimation of the temperature profile of the Arctic sea ice, and robust performance with respect to the unmodeled salinity effect and the uncertainties in physical parameters. --> 

    
 <!--   Arctic sea ice has been studied intensively in the field of climate science. One of the main reasons is due to ice-albedo feedback which influences climate dynamics due to the high reflectivity of sea ice. The other reason is the rapid decline of the Arctic sea ice extent in the recent decade shown in several satellite observations (see left figure reported by NASA). To predict the future sea ice extent, the online estimation of the sea ice temperature profile is crucial. My goal is to develop an observer algorithm to estimate temperature profile for the Arctic sea ice in a global climate model via some available measurements of sea ice from satellite data. -->
